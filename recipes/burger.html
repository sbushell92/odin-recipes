                <li>4 hamburger buns, preferably toasted</li>
                <li>8 slices of bacon, cooked until crispy</li>
                <li>4 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 cup barbecue sauce</li>
                <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
                <li>Tomato slices</li>
                <li>Red onion, thinly sliced</li>

            <h3 id="steps">Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Divide the ground beef into four equal portions and shape them into patties, slightly larger than the size of your burger buns. Season the patties with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
                <li>Place the burger patties on the preheated grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until desired doneness is reached. During the last minute of grilling, add a slice of cheddar cheese on each patty to melt.</li>
                <li>While the patties are cooking, prepare the bacon by frying or baking it until crispy. Drain the excess grease on paper towels.</li>
                <li>Once the patties are cooked and the cheese is melted, remove them from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>Spread barbecue sauce on the bottom half of each toasted bun.</li>
                <li>Place a cooked burger patty on top of the barbecue sauce, followed by two slices of crispy bacon.</li>
                <li>Top the bacon with lettuce leaves, tomato slices, and thinly sliced red onion.</li>
                <li>Finish by placing the top half of the bun on the assembled burger.</li>
                <li>Serve the Ultimate BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger immediately while it's still warm and enjoy!</li>
