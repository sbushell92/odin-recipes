                <ul>
                    <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/4 cups milk</li>
                    <li>1 large egg</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>1 cup fresh blueberries</li>
                    <li>Additional butter or oil for cooking</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, and granulated sugar until well combined.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract.</li>
                    <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix; a few lumps in the batter are fine.</li>
                    <li>Gently fold in the fresh blueberries, being careful not to crush them.</li>
                    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with butter or oil.</li>
                    <li>For each pancake, pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles form on the surface, then flip the pancake and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, adjusting the heat if necessary to prevent burning.</li>
                    <li>Serve the fluffy blueberry pancakes warm, with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, additional fresh blueberries, or a dusting of powdered sugar.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy your delightful stack of fluffy blueberry pancakes!</li>
