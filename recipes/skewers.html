        <p>Savor the irresistible flavors of our "Grilled Chicken Skewers with Mediterranean Marinade." These skewers are a delectable fusion of tender grilled chicken and vibrant Mediterranean-inspired seasonings. Each bite is a culinary journey that combines succulent chicken with zesty herbs and spices, leaving you craving for more.</p>
        <p>Our Grilled Chicken Skewers start with marinating juicy chicken chunks in a flavorful blend of Mediterranean ingredients. The marinade infuses the chicken with a harmonious medley of garlic, lemon, olive oil, and aromatic herbs, creating a delightful symphony of taste. As the skewers hit the grill, the heat locks in the marinade, resulting in juicy and perfectly charred chicken morsels that are bursting with flavor.</p>

                    <li>If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for about 30 minutes to prevent burning during grilling.</li>

                    <li>Thread the marinated chicken cubes onto skewers, dividing them evenly.</li>
                    <li>Place the chicken skewers on the preheated grill and cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has grill marks on all sides.</li>
                    <li>Remove the skewers from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, garnish with fresh parsley or mint leaves for added freshness and presentation.</li>
                    <li>Serve the Grilled Chicken Skewers with Mediterranean Marinade hot and enjoy the succulent flavors of the Mediterranean.</li>
